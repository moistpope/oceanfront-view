# Oceanfront View internals

How the HUD decodes, fuses and draws what it shows: the detail behind the [README](README.md).

## The view

Speed, gear, MADS steering state, ACC set speed and time gap, speed limit, alerts, the ADAS module's
lane lines and object list in 3D, parking sensors, and the comma's CAN overrides
(`opendbc/car/fisker/values.py`) and replay of recorded routes, through the bridge.

The ego car mirrors the real one: a detailed, rigged Ocean model (Pulse Ocean v0.10, at its true
size in meters) in any of the factory paints and five wheel options (Settings > Display). A fine
textured ground moves under it with speed and steering (dead-reckoned about the rear axle with the
bicycle model from `steeringAngleDeg`), the wheels roll and the front pair steers, and the model's own
lamps light up, following the BCM's lamp outputs (`BCM_0x335`, falling back to carState): DRLs,
headlights, the lower front strips (white DRL, amber while indicating), quarter-panel and rear turn
indicators, tail, brake, third brake light and reversing lamps (`static/js/lamps.js`). The red and amber
lamps get a soft glow so they read from the chase camera. The car reflects a soft studio environment of its own
(`studioEnvironment` in `scene.js`), so its glossy paint, glass and chrome trim catch highlights.

Lanes and objects are filtered before drawing (`static/js/road.js`, `scene.js`): lane lines are
carried with the car's motion and eased toward each measurement by confidence, with hysteresis on
validity; objects are tracked with an alpha-beta filter. The default *Blended* lane source takes
the ADAS lines and refines each with openpilot's matching line where they agree, adding lines only
openpilot sees when it's confident. Lanes neither reports are filled in as a softer, inferred road:
lane count and width from ADAS lines/lane info and openpilot's outer lines and road edges (the road
between the edges is split into lanes and the car put in its slot), held for a while, else the
car's own path. A lane count drops only after 8 s without the lane, since the outer lines flicker.
The cameras name lines by where they are from the car, so a lane change renames every line at once.
That's recognized (both ego lines a lane over from where the carried lane puts them), and the carried
road is renamed with them, so it stays put on the ground instead of sliding a lane sideways.

Lanes are drawn only when the HUD is confident of them. *Lane confidence* is spatio-temporal: it's
kept on stations fixed to the road every 5 m of distance driven, from just behind the car to 100 m
ahead, so what was learned about a stretch of road stays with it as the car drives onto it. Each
station eases toward how much stable lane evidence there is at its distance: the ego lane's lines
where they're plausible (on their side of the car, a lane's width apart, along our heading),
weighted by their confidence, by how far ahead they can be trusted, and by how stable they've been
(a running mean of how far each new measurement lands from where the carried line predicted it), or
else openpilot's road edges. It rises within a second or so and falls slowly: over 10 s standing
still, faster with distance driven (2 s in Park), so a lane has to hold steady to be trusted and a
short dropout doesn't lose it. The lanes show once the stations over the next 30 m average past the
threshold (*Display → Lane confidence*, 50% by default, with a live readout), and hide below 80% of
it. On the logged drive, clean highway lanes show 1–2 s after they appear and settle at 90–97%.

The ground (`static/js/ground.js`) is drawn as one field with the road. With no lanes to show (at
start, in a parking lot, at low speed without lines) it's a disc of about 10 m radius around the car
that fades out over its outer half. Once the lanes show, the disc grows out into the road, first
across to the outer lines plus a shoulder, then down the road as far as the lane confidence reaches
(70–80 m on the highway), fading out at the far end. Disc and road are signed distance fields joined
with a smooth minimum, the road's computed in its own coordinates (station along it and offset across
it, exact for the arcs the lines are drawn as), and every part of the shape is eased on springs. So
any change morphs: lanes found or lost, a lane added or dropped, the road bending. The edge is
roughened with noise fixed to the ground, which ripples and flows while the shape is changing and
holds still when it isn't. Lane lines, stop lines, crosswalks and the headlight throw are cut by the
same field, so they grow, bend and dissolve with the road. Ground texture and inferred road can be
turned off under *Display*.

Traffic lights, signs and road markings (`static/js/furniture.js`) come from the car's ADAS camera
only; sunnypilot adds map speed limits (`liveMapDataSP`) but no signs or lights. The camera reports
what it saw and, for lights and markings, how far ahead, never where across the road: the ego-lane
traffic light (color, arrow, solid/blinking, lamp count, orientation) floats over our lane at its
distance (else the stop line's or a landmark's, else an estimate); a speed-limit sign the camera
just read (`ADAS_TSRSts` Vision mode or a new value) or a prohibition sign (`ADAS_FobdSign`) goes up
at the roadside a little ahead, beyond the outer lane on our side; stop lines and crosswalks are
drawn across the road at their distance. All of them are anchored to the road, not to the ground: a
station down the road (distance driven) and an offset across it, placed each frame on the road as
it's drawn then (`RoadModel.place`). A sign 50 m down a road drawn curving left that turns out to
run straight is, 10 m later, 40 m down the straight road and still beside it. The camera doesn't
classify stop or yield signs. The ICC also
sends an ADASIS v2 map horizon (`ICC_0x250`..`0x255`, `0x361`) with map signs and lanes per
direction; its sign type table isn't in the matrix, so it isn't used yet.

*Power trails* (`static/js/tracks.js`, *Display*): the rear tires leave trails of fine glowing
particles on the road, a dense bright band as wide as each tire with a soft glow about it and
sparser dust that spreads out behind, colored by how hard the motors are asked to pull when each is
laid: blue at a light load through the spectrum to red at full power (150 kW demanded, or 6000 Nm of
wheel torque for a hard launch; regen counts as light), and denser with more dust the harder the car
pulls. Laid particles keep their color, so a burst of power slides back behind the car as a red
stretch. The trail grows with speed to one car length at 70 mph and fades out toward its end. The
load is the
driver's torque request per axle (`VCU_0x102`, wheel torque) times motor speed (`MCU_F_0x150`,
`MCU_R_0x151`) over the ~11.5:1 drive ratio; on other cars it's estimated from openpilot's
acceleration. The chase camera also backs off with speed, up to 1.5x its distance at 70 mph,
keeping any zoom you set. In every view the camera's heading follows the car's on a critically
damped spring (`CAM_YAW_W` in `scene.js`, at most 0.6 rad behind): in a sharp low-speed turn the car
swings round in the frame and the camera catches up as it straightens out; on the highway the lag
is a degree or two.

*Radar objects* (*Display*, off by default): the tracks of the car's mid-range radar, read from its
private CAN-FD link on panda bus 1 (`static/js/world/fisker_radar.js`), drawn as see-through teal cars with a ring on
the ground at the point each track reports. It's there to check the radar decoding against the
camera's cars before the radar feeds openpilot. The radar's messages aren't in the FM29 matrix:
`dbc/fisker_ocean_mrr.dbc` (a copy of opendbc's) is reverse-engineered from a drive, and its comments
say how each scale was checked and which are still open. Tracks are drawn close to raw (each 65 ms
cycle's position, carried on the radar's own velocity for at most a cycle), so a scale or sign error
shows up as an offset from the camera's car; like those cars, a car ahead sits with its rear on the
reported point. A chip at the top right shows the radar's track count, or *no radar* when the log (or harness)
has no radar frames.

*Objects* (*Display*): the default *World model* (`static/js/world/world_model.js`) fuses the radar, the ADAS camera list
and openpilot's leads into one object set in a ground-fixed frame: each measurement is placed at the
time it was taken (radar MeasTime from the bus's time sync; the others by typical latency) using an
ego pose dead-reckoned from ESP wheel speed and the YRS yaw-rate gyro, and weighted by its source's
noise model (radar: range and Doppler; camera: bearing, class, size; openpilot leads only corroborate
on this car). The view anchors the objects to the ground, so parked cars stay put through turns; the
scene's own ego motion now uses the gyro too. *Raw sources* draws each source as it reports. Radar
tracks younger than 1.3 s are hidden unless *All radar tracks* is on. A world object is drawn with its
center half a car length beyond the reported point along the car's own axis (half a width when seen
side-on), since every source reports the face nearest us.

Before fusing, each source is corrected by the *measured sensor calibration* (`MEASURED_CALIBRATION` in
`world_model.js`, *Display → Geometry calibration*, on by default). Its values come from replaying
`000000b5--bfe13ac451` and `000000b4--d0f733ebb2` against GPS, openpilot's leads and lane lines:
- The ADAS object list's range is 0.8× the radar's plus ~3 m (~0.25 m/bit from about the rear axle), so
  it's read as `x / 0.80 − 3.7`.
- Its lateral reads 1.35× too wide.
- Its latency is ~0.23 s.
- The radar's Doppler is 1/16 m/s per bit (not 0.06), and its output is turned 0.6° left.
- The wheel speed reads 3.1% under GPS, which the odometry and the view's ego motion correct.
- openpilot's leads read 0.2 m short (the camera is ~1.72 m behind the radar).

Uncorrected, a car the ADAS list and the radar both see splits in two at range and the copies cross at
~10–15 m. The switch is a setting of this screen (*Display → Debug*). The radar
sometimes sends a cycle twice, and `fisker_radar.js` hands each cycle out once. openpilot's `leadTwo`
(its lead 2 s from now) only counts when it's clearly another car than `leadOne`. Two tracks one radar or
ADAS id fed within a second are merged.

Each world-model object has a confidence, and the view fades it in between 35% and 65% and hides it
below that. The radar measures no elevation (nothing decoded so far gives height), so overhead
traffic lights, sign gantries and bridges read as stopped cars in our lane until it passes under
them and drops the track (radar track 791 on `000000b5--bfe13ac451--12` at 0:45–0:48: a traffic
light the radar called a 3 m wide, 0.6 m long car, dropped 24 m out). A camera positively
classifying an object (an ADAS class, or an openpilot lead) settles it at 100%. The radar alone
never shows a point target it hasn't classified: that takes a second, camera detection (anything in
the ADAS list, or an openpilot lead). A class counts once the radar has given it for 5 cycles, since
a class can flicker on for a single cycle (radar track 468). A radar-only object it has classified
stays hidden until its radar track has lasted 1.3 s. After that it gets 85% if it moves over the
ground and 60% (drawn a little see-through) if it stands. A standing object drops to about 33% if
the radar has drawn it at least 4 times wider than long and 1.5 m wide, and to 15% once openpilot's
model has missed it for 0.5 s in plain view: standing within 1.5 m of our path, 8–80 m ahead, above
5 m/s, with no camera-seen or moving object in front of it. Once no source has reported an object for
0.3 s it can't rise; a moving one fades out (*coasting*) rather than carry on along a velocity that's
now a guess, while a standing one waits (a parked car the radar loses in a turn). *Low-confidence objects*
(*Display*, off by default) draws the hidden ones faintly, and *Object stats* gives each object's
confidence and the reason for it (*vision*, *moving*, *standing*, *thin*, *unseen*, *young*,
*unclassified*, *coasting*). Paused, each object shows its settled confidence.

*Object stats* (*Display*, off by default, `static/js/labels.js`): a debug tag over every object the
view draws, giving its source (the ADAS camera's list, an openpilot lead, the radar), track ID and
class, position (x ahead, y left/right), speed over the ground and relative, heading and size, in m,
m/s and degrees. The ADAS list has no speeds; its tags show this view's tracking estimate (*est*). An
openpilot lead merged into an ADAS car is listed on that car's tag. Tags stack instead of overlapping,
so an object two sources report shows both.

Music and navigation (`static/js/infotainment.js`, *Display*, on): on the car's screen, the Android
app passes on what the head unit is playing and its navigation's next turn (see
[`android/`](android/README.md#music-and-navigation)). What's playing shows in a card at the bottom
with its art, progress and previous / play-pause / next, which control the head unit's player. The
next turn shows in a card at the top: the maneuver, its distance, the street and the trip (time,
distance, arrival). Within 160 m an arrow lies on the ego lane at the turn, bending the way it goes
(`static/js/navarrow.js`). The navigation app rounds its distances (0.3 mi is anywhere from 0.25 to
0.35), so the turn is pinned to the road when it's first given and carried along with the car, and
each later distance only nudges it back inside what that distance allows. In a plain browser, without
the app, neither card shows. *Display → Debug → Demo music & navigation* plays a made-up playlist and
route (the turns come nearer as the car drives), for trying them without the car.

The car's own buses (`static/js/carstate.js`, `cancmd.js`, `ibus_tables.js`): on Pulse — the add-on board
the app runs on — the two CAN controllers are wired to the car's IBUS1 and IBUS2. The app reads what
the gateway broadcasts there and forwards every frame to the page (see
[`android/`](android/README.md#the-cars-own-buses)). Two things come of that:

- **The HUD.** The gateway mirrors the ADAS bus onto IBUS2 for the head unit, with the same layout and
  signal names, and IBUS1 carries speed, gear, steering, yaw and the body. The page's world-model worker
  decodes these frames with a DBC generated from the IBUS matrices (`dbc/fisker_ocean_ibus.dbc`,
  `tools/gen_ibus.py`): the status card, lanes, objects, signs, lights and parking sensors all work from
  the car alone. The comma, when connected, joins this view with openpilot and the radar (above); with no
  frames at all, the driving data comes off the screen and the car controls, music and navigation carry
  on. The *Signals* tab browses IBUS1 and IBUS2 live, every message the app reads (and the comma's ADAS
  bus while it's connected).
- **Live car controls.** The car-control menus show a "From the car" block at the top of each menu and
  their controls follow what the car reports (`carcatalog.js` `live`, from the generated table of status
  signals): locks, doors, the liftgate, windows, sunroof, mirrors, lights, climate, seat heat, gear, drive
  mode, battery and charging. The 3D car follows the same values: open doors swing open, windows sit
  where they are, the liftgate lifts as far as the car says. Setting a control **sends the head unit's
  own control message** to the car (`tx`: windows auto up/down, lock, liftgate, sunroof position,
  mirrors, lamps, climate, seat heat and seat moves, the locking settings), and the car's answer shows
  when it comes. What can't be sent is greyed with why (`off`): either the car has no message for it, or
  the head unit sends that message itself every second with its own values (drive mode, regen, creep,
  charge limit and current, brightness, ambient light, California Mode), or one frame would carry every
  audio volume along (ICC_0x44/0x46). Energy shows the charging power, pack voltage and current, time
  left, limits and the battery's health. In a plain browser nothing is live and nothing is sent: the
  controls stay a mockup. *Display → Debug → Demo live car state* fills the read-out with made-up values.

Pulse's CAN driver has hardware acceptance filters (`/sys/module/mcp251x/parameters/rxb_*`) whose
defaults pass only parts of the ID range and would keep the seat and mirror positions, the liftgate's,
the steering angle, yaw rate, battery current and the charging times from ever arriving. The app sets
them at start to the tightest filters that pass every ID it reads (`CanIds.HW_FILTERS`, generated by
`tools/gen_ibus.py`); that needs its root shell, and without root those read-outs stay empty and the
car-only view has no steering or yaw. See `android/README.md`.

Frame rate (`static/js/perf.js`, *Display → Debug*, on for now): a counter under the status card,
over the car controls' panel. Tap it for the slowest frame of the last second, the HUD's own script
time per frame, draw calls, triangles and the render resolution. *Render resolution* is *Auto* by
default: while frames come slower than the screen refreshes (88% of it, two seconds running), it first
drops the blur behind the HUD's cards, then lowers the 3D view's resolution in steps to 60%, and brings
them back a step at a time once frames have kept up for 8 s (a step that slows things straight down
again waits a minute). *Full*, *75%* and *50%* fix it, for comparing on the car.

*Full speed in Ready* (*Display → Debug*, on by default) is the Android app's: while the car is in
Ready it hands the page the car's CAN frames every screen frame instead of at 15 Hz and, with root,
holds Pulse's CPU and GPU at their top speed and gives the CAN chips' interrupts a core of their own
and real-time priority, putting it all back when Ready ends (`PerfBoost`, see `android/README.md`).
The line under the switch shows what took.

Where the work is done: the car's buses are decoded in the page (above), and the comma's process is a
*bridge*. It reads its buses and openpilot's services and streams them to the page as they are -- the ADASBUS and radar frames the HUD decodes
(raw, allowlisted by message), and openpilot's services in compact form (`extract.py`) -- in ticks at
20 Hz over the WebSocket. The page decodes them and runs the world model itself, in a worker off its
main thread (`static/js/world/`: `dbc.js`, `fisker_world.js`, `fisker_radar.js`, `world_model.js`,
`state.js`, `merge.js`, `worker.js`), and hands the view the same state snapshots the comma used to
build. So the car's own screen carries the HUD, the comma stays light, and the Android app runs the
whole page from its own package, from the car's buses, with or without the comma. The
DBCs come down as files (`/dbc/`). `tools/record_ticks.mjs` saves a running server's tick stream and
`tools/replay_ticks.mjs` runs the same pipeline in Node over it, for working on the decoding and fusion
without a browser; the tests are in `static/js/world/tests/` (`node --test static/js/world/tests/*.test.js`).

Where the car is (`static/js/world/pose.js`, the snapshot's `pose`): the worker keeps the rear axle's
pose in a local east/north frame from the car's odometry (wheel speed and yaw-rate gyro at CAN rate),
corrected by the telematics box's GPS fixes (`TBOX_0x526`, 10 Hz, mirrored on bus 0 and IBUS2) and its
fused heading (`TBOX_0x179`), or by the comma's `gpsLocation(External)` when the car's own isn't there.
A fix describes where the car was ~0.2 s earlier (measured on both receivers), so it is matched against
the pose the odometry had then and the difference nudges the whole recent track; the heading sensor keeps
the gyro's integration straight and estimates its bias; the fixes calibrate the wheel speed (it reads ~3%
low) and, on drives varied enough to tell, the GPS lag. The view's ground frame follows this pose
(`scene.js` `_followPose`), so GPS corrections slide the ground under the car instead of stepping it, and
map geometry can be drawn in the same frame. `tools/pose_eval.mjs` reports how it did on a recording.

The road from the map (`static/js/world/osmtile.js`, `mapdata.js`, `mapmatch.js`; the snapshot's `map`): the
worker reads the OpenStreetMap road tiles sunnypilot's mapd uses (one packed Cap'n Proto file per 0.25 deg
tile, 2 x 2 deg cells from `map-data.pfeifer.dev`, the same files mapd keeps under `<media>/osm/offline/`),
asks its own server for them (`GET /map/tile/<lat>/<lon>/<name>`: `maptiles.py` on the comma or a PC,
`MapTiles.kt` in the app, both downloading a cell the first time and keeping it), projects the drivable
ways into the pose's frame and indexes their segments on a grid. The matcher scores the ways within 40 m
by distance and heading (one-way respected), stays on the current way until an unconnected one has won for
a while or the current one has ended, and follows the most likely continuation (same ref or name, then the
smallest turn) ~500 m ahead into a *horizon*: the centerline polyline in the pose frame with the roads
branching off it (offset along, angle, class, name). The match is which road and roughly where along it,
never which lane. On the recorded drives it agreed with mapd's road name 90-100% of the time
(`tools/map_eval.mjs`).

Drawing it (`static/js/mapsurface.js`, `ground.js`, `scene.js` `_road`; *Display → Map road*): two separate
road sources, never blended. The cameras' road model (`road.js`, the single arc from the lane lines) always
runs and is what the view draws when there is no map: no tiles, no match, the toggle off. Once the matcher
has had the road under us for half a second the view switches to the map's road and stays on it until the
match has been gone for two seconds (the last good match carries it through a short coast). The map is
then the road's only geometry: its centerline polyline is the ground field's reference instead of the arc,
with the carriageway as wide as the lane count says, and the lane lines are the map road's own structure
(edges, a two-way road's centerline, lane boundaries) as parallel offsets of it, opened at the junctions
along it. What the cameras add is *which lane* the car is drawn in: the map has no lanes and the GPS and
the OSM centerline are both meter-level, so the car is placed in a lane of the map's road (counted from the
right) and the whole map slides sideways -- with a 1.5 s time constant, never faster than 0.4 m/s -- so
that lane's center passes where the cameras see the ego lane's center at the car (lanes 3.6 m wide, the
map's, since the network's lines are drawn with that). A lane change moves the lane index, not the map. Without lanes
seen the car keeps the lane it had (or starts in the right lane); only a GPS that insists for five seconds
that we are 0.8 lane widths over moves the drawn lane by one. The lanes may also turn the map about the
car by at most 2 deg (3 s time constant). The two structure lines bounding the drawn lane are the ego
lane's: they take the HMI's blue and red like the cameras' lines did. Junctions are drawn as a map draws
them (`mapsurface.js` `junctions`): each road leaving or joining ours is a strip of ground in its own
width for its first 60 m whose edges curve into ours with fillets (tight at a street corner, a long taper
at a ramp's gore), our edge line opens across the mouth between the fillets, our lane dashes stop inside a
crossing with arms on both sides, and the arm gets its own centerline or lane boundaries past the mouth.
One-way roads that end at a node on our road (on-ramps, merging lanes) are included as arms too.

Under all of it lies the map itself: every road within 320 m of the car (`roadnet.js`, from the snapshot's
`map.roads`, rebuilt by the worker once the car has moved 40 m) as ground-fixed strips in their own widths
with edges, centerlines and lane boundaries. Their meshes are laid out in `roadnetworker.js`, off the page's
thread (a town's network took 40-60 ms there on the head unit, a dropped frame or three each time). This is the one source of lane lines for every road, the one
we're on included (so nothing toggles when the match or the horizon moves from one way to the next); the
field only highlights the drawn lane's two lines in the HMI's blue or red on top of them, and draws the
junction fillets. Lines open where roads meet: an edge between the fillets' tangent points (the geometry the
fillets are drawn with, so they meet), the inner lines across the other road's width; a way that simply
goes on into the next (the same road split, a shallow end-to-end bend) opens nothing. The map's layers sit
under a group (`scene.js` `_alignMap`) that takes the same
slide and turn the lane placement gives the road we're on, so the whole map moves as one with it. And what
stands along the roads (`mapfeatures.js`, from the layer's `features`): the road tiles hold no point
features, so the server fetches them from the Overpass API once per 0.05 deg cell (`GET
/map/features/<klat>/<klon>`, `maptiles.py` `MapFeatures` / `MapFeatures.kt`, kept under
`<media>/osm/features/`; a busy Overpass is retried, a cell that fails is asked for again later) and the
worker keeps the ones that sit on a node of a road it knows (state.js `_features`), each with the road
directions arriving at it. A traffic signal gets a head over the right lane of each arriving direction,
facing it, with a stop line; the head ahead on our own road takes the camera's light state (`fisker.tlr`),
so the map says where the light is and the camera what it shows, and the camera's own floating light is
not drawn then. Stop and give-way signs stand at the right edge of their road 4 m before the node, facing
the traffic they hold (OSM's `direction`, a stop at a way's end holds the traffic reaching it, one on an
intersection node the minor roads unless `stop=all`), with a stop line; marked pedestrian crossings are
striped across the road; level crossings get a crossbuck and a line; traffic calming three stripes; a
mini-roundabout its ring. Speed limits are left to the camera's read of the real sign (the map's are often
stale, and two signs for one limit confuse). So the car is placed on the map, and
the roads around it and what stands along them are there whether or not the matcher has an opinion about
them.

Nothing of the map is ever dropped from disk, and it is fetched ahead: as the car moves, the worker asks its
server to download everything within *Display → Map download* (default 25 km; `POST /map/prefetch {lat, lon,
radius_km}`, every 3 km or 2 min), and the server (`maptiles.py` `MapPrefetch` / `MapPrefetch.kt`) works
through the 0.25 deg tiles within that radius nearest first, in one background thread: the road tile's 2 x 2
deg cell if it isn't on disk, then the tile's features in one Overpass request (a tile at a time, split into
the 0.05 deg cells the page reads; ~0.5 MB and a few seconds for a town, with a pause between requests). `GET
/map/status` says how far it has got, and the settings panel shows it. A later drive through the area needs
no network at all. The road we're on is named at the bottom center of the screen (the match's name and ref,
else mapd's road name). At a junction the horizon takes a continuation only if it turns less than 55 deg (any turn short of
a U-turn when it keeps the name or ref, or is the only way on, i.e. a bend OSM split into two ways; drops
down the road hierarchy penalized) and stops where the road would double back, so a wrong guess at a turn
is a road that ends rather than one that loops; where the road itself ends the field fades within 12 m. A
way the current one leads into takes over only when the current one ends within 6 m; any other way must
win clearly for 8 snapshots, so a ramp running beside the road doesn't pull the horizon onto itself. The
head unit's ADASIS horizon (`ICC_0x361`, `0x250`, `0x251`, `0x255`) is the same idea from the car's own
navigation and serves as the cross-check.

The pose the map is placed by is the *shown* pose (`pose.js` `SHOW_*`; the snapshot's `pose.x/y/h`, with the
estimate itself in `pose.est` and the difference in `pose.offset`): the same odometry, so the car's own
motion is exact and immediate, but the GPS and heading corrections reach it with a 2 s time constant and
never faster than 0.05 + 0.02 |v| m/s sideways, 0.1 + 0.05 |v| m/s along, 1.5 deg/s in heading. The ground
never steps under the car; a lane line never jumps with a fix. Only the first fix, the first heading, and a
disagreement past 10 m or 15 deg (a restart on persistent outliers) move it outright (`pose.snaps` counts
those). The matcher still uses the estimate. On the recorded drives the shown pose trailed the estimate
sideways by 0.1-0.8 m typically and up to 3.5 m briefly after a correction; since the lane placement
absorbs sideways error, that shows as the map gliding under the car, not as the car off its lane.

Loading: static files carry an `ETag`/`Last-Modified`, and the server answers a current copy with
`304`. In a browser the page's service worker (`static/sw.js`) keeps the car model, three.js and the
app's files in Cache Storage and checks them on each load, so the ~25 MB model crosses the network
once. It needs a secure context, such as `localhost`; a plain `http://sunnypilot.local` tab uses the
HTTP cache instead. The Android app serves everything from its own APK and doesn't use it. The
day/night theme is applied from the saved setting before the first paint.

## ADASBUS signals used

Bus 2 (ADAS module) unless noted; the full set is in the *Signals* tab.

- **Lanes:** `0x339` LeLine1, `0x20A/0x20B` LeLine2/3, `0x20C/0x20D/0x20E` RiLine1/2/3 (offset, heading, curvature radius, type, color, confidence); `0x20F` lane width + lane types; `0x340` what the cluster draws (blue while lane centering, red/flash on departure); `0x350` adjacent lane widths/types, oncoming lanes, landmarks, crosswalk/stop line, construction; `0x210` curbs.
- **Objects:** `0x33B 0x34B 0x32D 0x33D 0x34D 0x32F 0x33F 0x34F` ADAS_Obj1..8 (position, size, heading, class, brake light). Highlights come from `0x31C` ACC primary/secondary target, `0x353` leading vehicle, `0x315` BSD/DOW threat IDs, `0x31A` AEB/rear-AEB/BACM threat IDs, `0x31B` ELKA threat. Positions decode at 0.2 m/bit, not the matrix's 0.5 (checked against openpilot's leads; corrected in `tools/gen_world_dbc.py`), so the list reaches ~50 m. Against the radar the range fits ~0.25 m/bit from about the rear axle instead; the world model's sensor calibration corrects for that, and the raw view shows the list as decoded. Cars are drawn from this list; openpilot's two leads (from the comma camera; the Fisker port has no radar) fill in only where the ADAS has no car, and a re-IDed ADAS track is merged rather than shown twice.
- **ACC / assist:** `0x313` ACC state, TJA autosteer, ISA/TSR/TLR state; `0x31C` set speed, time gap (+ recommendation), icon, function type; `0x314` LKA/ELKA/ESA/LCA/APA/DOW/BSD/DCAA/AHBA states; `0x31B` lane-change trajectory and hands-on request; `0x342` HOD, haptic and turn-lamp requests.
- **Warnings:** `0x317` chimes, takeover request, cluster/mirror warnings, fault text; `0x31A` AEB warning/intervention and telltales; `0x311` degradation pop-ups.
- **Signs & lights:** `0x311` TSR speed limit (+ unit), `0x210` sign condition, no-passing, traffic light color/shape, `0x351` traffic light distance, lead turn signal/brake, `0x334` prohibition signs, camera blockage.
- **Parking:** `0x352` ultrasonic zones (front/rear/left/right × 4), `0x356/0x359` park-distance (cm), `0x2C7..0x2EA` APA slots, `0x2CD` curb warnings, `0x316` surround-view state.
- **Driver monitoring:** `0x527`. **Camera:** `0x32B`.
- **Vehicle (bus 0):** `VCU_0x102` driver torque request per axle, `MCU_F_0x150`/`MCU_R_0x151` motor torque + speed, `VCU_0x214` gear/ready/pedal, `ICC_0x531` cluster speed + unit, `BCM_0x335` lamp outputs, `EPS_0x1C2` steering angle, `BCM_0x343` doors/locks/windows, `PLGM_0x471` liftgate, `ECC_0x373` outside temp, `VCU_0x358` regen/e-pedal, `ICC_0x52A`/`ICC_0x35B` the ICC's own settings (shown next to the overrides).
- **Position (bus 0, from the telematics box through the gateway):** `TBOX_0x526` GPS lat/lon (10 Hz), `TBOX_0x525` altitude, `TBOX_0x179` fused heading + std dev, `TBOX_0x174..0x176` its IMU (the forward velocity calibrates the wheel speed; the angular rates don't match the chassis gyro's scale and aren't used). The fix quality (`0x46B..0x473`: fix OK, HDOP, satellites, horizontal accuracy) is on IBUS1 only, so the app sees it and the comma doesn't.
- **Map horizon (bus 0, the head unit's ADASIS v2 from its navigation):** `ICC_0x361` position on path (offset, probability, age ~150 ms, relative heading), `ICC_0x250` segment (road class, form of way, lanes, speed-limit class), `ICC_0x251` stubs (branches, turn angle), `ICC_0x255` profile short (curvature, slope, ~900 m ahead; value 511 = straight), `ICC_0x252` profile long (signs), `ICC_0x362` meta. Forwarded by the bridge and read on IBUS2, not decoded yet (the IBUS2 matrix has 0x255's header three bits off; `tools/gen_ibus.py` corrects it to the standard layout the car sends).

Not documented in the matrix, so exposed as display toggles (*Display → Geometry calibration*): the
sign of lane curvature and of object heading (lane heading grows to the right, verified on the car).
Verify them on a drive with good lane confidence against the openpilot lanes (*Lane lines → Both*).
